## PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
link:  https://saikalyan11.github.io/Portfolio/

I developed a professional-looking **` Website`** to showcase my **skills** and collaborate with me.
This **`website``** is used to contact me from anywhere in the world and collaborate. Moreover, This website contains most of my hard work on using different kinds of fonts and **Responsive Web Design**.

## **Getting Started**

We all know how to design websites with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**. And this website is also designed in the same way.

Mostly, it is designed with **HTML** and **CSS**, so no prior software is needed.

## **Pre-requisites**

You can use your **notepad** which is already in your 🖥️**System**.
It’s better 😌 to use an **IDE,** this **IDE** gives some shortcuts while writing code.
I prefer to use **VS Code** because it is used for all programming languages. But most of the coders use different **_IDE_** for different languages. VS Code gives me a separate list of features to complete my work 10 times faster than using Notepad.
Anything does the same work, and it depends on your speed, usage, and planning.


## **Installation**

- Want to learn with my code by editing:

- It’s pretty straightforward⏩ :
